<p>The following verses were sent to compete for the prize
offered in October last, by the Montreal Caledonian Society,
for the &ldquo;best poem on Halloween.&rdquo; They were not successful;
and some may be ready to ask, &ldquo;Why then publish
them?&rdquo; It may be sufficient to reply, &ldquo;I choose to do so;&rdquo;
&ldquo;I choose to appeal from the award of the Judges to the
decision of the public.&rdquo; A single sentence will explain why
I make such an appeal. The gentlemen appointed to act
as judges based their decision, according to their published
statement, as much upon &ldquo;suitability for recitation at a
public festival,&rdquo; as upon &ldquo;literary merit.&rdquo; Had this been
stated in the advertisement inviting competition it would
have been all right. But it is very evident that all poems
which might be judged unsuitable for such recitation,
would necessarily be excluded from competition, whatever
might be their &ldquo;literary merits,&rdquo; and the successful production
could only be that which among the &ldquo;suitable&rdquo;
was regarded as possessing the greatest literary excellence.
It is on this ground&mdash;and not because I could be so vain as
to think that my production <i>ought</i> to have received the prize,
while I was altogether unacquainted with not a few others
which may have been rejected on the same principle&mdash;that
I complain of the award of the Judges, and that I now appeal
from that award by this publication.</p>

<p>A poem may be very well suited for recitation at a public
festival, and possess very slight claims to any literary
merit, while another indefinitely superior might not in
such circumstances be suitable for recitation at all.</p>

<p>With the public I now leave the decision, and shall cheerfully
acquiesce in its award whether favourable or the
reverse.</p>

<tr><td>This night we meet o&rsquo; a&rsquo; the nights,<br />
    For fun the very wale,<br />
    When melancholy taks its flight,<br />
    And graning pains grow hale;<br />
    When young anes, wi&rsquo; sic antic tricks,<br />
    And wi&rsquo; their laughin&rsquo; music,<br />
    Gar auld anes tae forget their cares,<br />
    And feel&rsquo;t the best o&rsquo; physic.<br /><br />

    And though wi&rsquo; some we used to meet<br />
    We canna haud this night,<br />
    Yet we are here to show we ne&rsquo;er<br />
    Forget tho&rsquo; out o&rsquo; sight:&mdash;<br />
    And o&rsquo; a <span class="smcap">Halloween</span> langsyne,<br />
    I will to you rehearse,<br />
    And as a canter ye may like,<br />
    I&rsquo;ll gied to ye in verse.<br /><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
    Ae night gane bye, at gloamin&rsquo; time,<br />
    When there was muckle steer,<br />
    Mang witch mid warlock gathered far<br />
    To ride in high career,<br />
    Some callants met, a merry crew,<br />
    Yet each a decent chiel&mdash;<br />
    Though on that night a&rsquo; seem&rsquo;d possessed<br />
    O&rsquo; something o&rsquo; the deil.<br /><br />

    Their runts clean through and through were bored<br />
    And stuffed with raivelins fou,<br />
    And like a chimley when on fire<br />
    Each could the reek out spue:<br />
    And thus convened they council held,<br />
    Wi&rsquo; handsel whar they&rsquo;d gang;<br />
    A&rsquo; being settled and now dark,<br />
    They set off in a bang.<br /><br />

    It was resolved that they should try,<br />
    On Kate, their Jenny-reeker,<br />
    And see if &rsquo;twad hae ony guid<br />
    Upon a witch to smeek her:<br />
    Jock through the key-hole sent a cloud<br />
    That reached across the house,<br />
    While in below the door reek rushed<br />
    Like water through a sluice.<br /><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
    Kate maistly chock&rsquo;t, wi&rsquo; hostin&rsquo; seized,<br />
    Ran to the door for air,<br />
    Wi&rsquo; open mouth and gaspin&rsquo; much<br />
    O&rsquo; reek she caught the mair,<br />
    Nor could she speak but gasp for breath<br />
    When they took to their heel,<br />
    But black wi&rsquo; rage she shook her neive<br />
    And wished them wi&rsquo; the deil.<br /><br />

    But whether Kate had power or no<br />
    To put them &rsquo;neath his will,<br />
    Frae this &rsquo;twad seem they could na get<br />
    O&rsquo; mischief half their fill;<br />
    Frae door to door they madly ran,<br />
    Frae door to window flew,<br />
    Whare&rsquo;er a crack or hole they fand<br />
    They in the reek did spue:<br /><br />

    Till ilka door wide open flew<br />
    Wi&rsquo; bang against the wa&rsquo;,<br />
    And some ane gaspin&rsquo; shouted out<br />
    Some threat about the law;<br />
    Some chased, mair earnest, wi&rsquo; a stick;<br />
    Auld Jinker threw his last;<br />
    And Supplejoints wi&rsquo; elwand ran<br />
    Behind, though he ran fast:<br /><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
    On him they wheeled, and charging, fired,<br />
    In turn his Jenny-reeker,<br />
    Ane struck him on the head and bounced,<br />
    And ane gied him a keeker;<br />
    He turned his back and faster ran,<br />
    &rsquo;Twas now their turn to follow&mdash;<br />
    But ere he reached his door his head<br />
    Had mony a heich and hollow.<br /><br />

    Nae time was lost&mdash;to Rab&rsquo;s they ran,<br />
    But ere they reached the gate,<br />
    They haulted to mak sure their plan.<br />
    And guard against ill fate&mdash;<br />
    For weel they ken&rsquo;d that Rab would watch<br />
    His cabbages that night,<br />
    But they resolved that them they&rsquo;d hae<br />
    Afore the morning light.<br /><br />

    Twa slippit up and oped the yett<br />
    And tied across a rape,<br />
    The others creepit through the hedge<br />
    At whar there was a gape,<br />
    And creepin&rsquo; down amang the runts<br />
    They pued and pued their wale;<br />
    But Rab had spied the twa and thought<br />
    To catch them without fail.<br /><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
    They saw him tae, but ne&rsquo;er let on<br />
    Till he at them did grab,<br />
    Then shouted as they lap and ran<br />
    Weel done! weel done, our Rab!<br />
    Rab in pursuit wi&rsquo; a&rsquo; his might<br />
    Fell lengthways at the yett,<br />
    The groans he gied were as the fa&rsquo;,<br />
    For Rab was heavy wecht.<br /><br />

    But he, wi&rsquo; noise and very rage,<br />
    &rsquo;Twas said, went maist dementit,<br />
    And when he saw his cabbage smashed,<br />
    He fell right our and fentit&mdash;<br />
    For on his door wi&rsquo; batt&rsquo;ring rams<br />
    They made a grand attack,<br />
    And Rab within not darin&rsquo; out<br />
    Was sure he heard it crack.<br /><br />

    Nor yet on his alane did fa&rsquo;<br />
    The brunt o&rsquo; civil war;<br />
    A score and mae its hist&rsquo;ry bear<br />
    In mony a dreadfu&rsquo; scar;<br />
    And to relate a&rsquo; that befell,<br />
    The incidents attendin&rsquo;,<br />
    This night and maist another till&rsquo;t<br />
    Wad scarcely hear the endin&rsquo;:<br /><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
    How Supplejoints a lesson got<br />
    To be discrete and civil;<br />
    And how it gied the priest a text<br />
    On a&rsquo; the fruits o&rsquo; evil;<br />
    How Grannie Wilson&rsquo;s rack fell down<br />
    Wi&rsquo; sic a fearfu&rsquo; din,<br />
    And owre the floor in bick&rsquo;rin&rsquo; race<br />
    Ran pewter plate and spune.<br /><br />

    How Meg wi&rsquo; toothache girnin&rsquo; sat<br />
    When startled, sprang a loup<br />
    That cured her toothache, but she fell<br />
    And coup&rsquo;t the water stoup;<br />
    And how quiet Willie frae his bed&mdash;<br />
    Wha gaed till&rsquo;t aye at dark&mdash;<br />
    Put past endurance and a&rsquo; shame<br />
    Did chase them in his sark.<br /><br />

    But here the battle grew owre hot,<br />
    So dreadfu&rsquo; the alarms,<br />
    Now doors ahead wide open stood,<br />
    Wharin were mustered arms;<br />
    So what wi&rsquo; those in rear that charged,<br />
    And what wi&rsquo; those in front,<br />
    Against sic odds they ken&rsquo;d &rsquo;twas rash<br />
    To battle wi&rsquo; a runt:<br /><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
    So they retreated to the Crafts<br />
    And Council held o&rsquo; war&mdash;<br />
    A&rsquo; laughin&rsquo;, talkin&rsquo;, crackin&rsquo; jokes,<br />
    Uninjured by a scar&mdash;<br />
    When Robie said, come on, let&rsquo;s gang,<br />
    Hugh Christie let us cage;<br />
    Now, Hugh was crabbit and they liked<br />
    To put him in a rage.<br /><br />

    Wi&rsquo; tiptae steps they slippit up,<br />
    And firmly tied the door,<br />
    Then gently tirled&mdash;Hugh cried, &ldquo;Wha&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;<br />
    Will gied a cuddie&rsquo;s roar&mdash;<br />
    Hugh in a lowe, wi&rsquo; door in hand,<br />
    Said he would them he-haw,<br />
    When Jock like ony sheep did bae,<br />
    And Pate like cock did craw.<br /><br />

    Hugh finding that his threats were vain<br />
    For that the door was tied,<br />
    Began to swear, and kick, and pu&rsquo;<br />
    And &ldquo;let me out,&rdquo; he cried;<br />
    When raging like a very bear,<br />
    And down him ran the sweat,<br />
    They a&rsquo; put out their utmost skill<br />
    To mak him yet mair het.<br /><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
    Some squeak&rsquo;t on panes, some thump&rsquo;t the door,<br />
    Some rumbled on the wa&rsquo;<br />
    Wi&rsquo; muckle stanes, till Hugh was sure<br />
    The very house wad fa&rsquo;;&mdash;<br />
    Now, Tam, the laird, sat on his loom,<br />
    When hearin&rsquo; sic a racket<br />
    He hurried out sayin&rsquo; to himsel,<br />
    Sure Hugh has now gane crackit.<br /><br />

    But Tam was late&mdash;the stage was clear,<br />
    Yet Hugh still raged and swore&mdash;<br />
    Tam in gruff voice bid him be quiet&mdash;<br />
    What ailed him at the door?<br />
    Now this was mair than Hugh could stan&rsquo;<br />
    Frae Tam to get the wite,<br />
    And getting vent, he burst on Tam,<br />
    Then baith began to flyte.<br /><br />

    Hugh wanted out&mdash;Tam wanted in:<br />
    Each did the other blame&mdash;<br />
    Tam cried to Hugh, he&rsquo;d break the door&mdash;<br />
    Hugh cried to Tam, gae hame;<br />
    But how it ended I ne&rsquo;er learned,<br />
    But &rsquo;twas na then and there,<br />
    For, Hugh and Tam, they did&rsquo;na speak<br />
    For weeks, and may be mair.<br /><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
    And now to Peggie&rsquo;s they are aff,<br />
    Wha&rsquo;s gley&rsquo;d and maistly blin&rsquo;&mdash;<br />
    Hoot! haudawa guid folks! ne&rsquo;er fear!<br />
    They dinna mean o&rsquo; sin;<br />
    They&rsquo;re daft wi&rsquo; fun and this they ken&mdash;<br />
    A&rsquo;s game on Halloween&mdash;<br />
    For Baillies&rsquo; threats and Provosts&rsquo; laws<br />
    They dinna care a prein.<br /><br />

    Jock gied a backie-up to Tam,<br />
    And Jimmie he stood bye,<br />
    When Tam should gie the chess a rap<br />
    That he should then let fly:<br />
    Tam gied twa raps, and Jimmie quick<br />
    Upon the sole let clash,<br />
    Wi&rsquo; sic a noise that Peggie thought<br />
    Had fallen out the sash.<br /><br />

    She hurried to the door and then<br />
    Weel blackguarded them a,<br />
    As scoundrels, rascals and far war,<br />
    Though ne&rsquo;er a ane she saw;<br />
    Then owre the window &rsquo;gan to grape<br />
    And looked wi&rsquo; head agee,<br />
    But fient a hole or crack she fand<br />
    And far less ane could see.<br /><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
    While graping here, and keeking there<br />
    In search o&rsquo; cracks and hole&mdash;<br />
    For she was sure that some were broke,<br />
    For glass was on the sole&mdash;<br />
    Jock slippit up behind, unheard,<br />
    And kittled quiet her lug,<br />
    And ere she could to him turn round<br />
    He neist gied her a hug.<br /><br />

    In muckle rage that ane would daur<br />
    Wi&rsquo; her sic freedom tak,<br />
    She hurried in and quick took down<br />
    A jug beside the rack,<br />
    And filling it wi&rsquo; water het<br />
    Frae kettle on the hob,<br />
    She sware his fairin she&rsquo;d gie him<br />
    For sic a shameless job:<br /><br />

    But muckle war for Peggie &rsquo;twas<br />
    To get in sic a fike,<br />
    Far better had she taen a stra<br />
    And kittled a wasps&rsquo; bike&mdash;<br />
    For Nellie Brash was passing bye,<br />
    A fish-wife for a tongue,<br />
    And Peggie seeing something move<br />
    On her the water flung.<br /><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
    But Gude preserve us! what a screigh!<br />
    And what a dreadfu&rsquo; aith!<br />
    Than limmar, jad, far war wi&rsquo; aithis<br />
    She ca&rsquo;d her in hale-claith;<br />
    And working hersel&rsquo; up to wark,<br />
    Wi&rsquo; screigh like ony fien&rsquo;,<br />
    She rushed on Peggie like a hawk,<br />
    And swore she&rsquo;d straucht her een.<br /><br />

    But Johnnie wi&rsquo; a pluck that night<br />
    Was seen gaun in his door&mdash;<br />
    Now, a&rsquo; that ken&rsquo;d him, ken&rsquo;d that he<br />
    A pluck did &rsquo;maist adore;<br />
    But maist a jaddie he did like,<br />
    Aboon a&rsquo; ye could name,<br />
    For never man liked woman sic<br />
    As Johnnie liked his wame:<br /><br />

    And Geordie guessing what was up,<br />
    Led aff his gallant corps&mdash;<br />
    Thinking it prudent Nell and Peg<br />
    Should settle their ain score&mdash;<br />
    They helped him up upon the dyke<br />
    And canny he crawled up<br />
    The gavil cape-stanes on his knees,<br />
    Till lum-head he did grup;<br /><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
    And raxing up upon his taes,<br />
    He neist looked down the lum,<br />
    Just then he heard a lively skirl<br />
    And Johnnie&rsquo;s weel-pleased hum,<br />
    And, thro&rsquo; a pue o&rsquo; steam and reek,<br />
    He saw amid a glow<br />
    The pan and in&rsquo;t a fork did pat<br />
    As to the tune&mdash;&ldquo;My Joe&rdquo;!<br /><br />

    And bending owre he aimed fair<br />
    A stane as big &rsquo;s my han&rsquo;,<br />
    And drappin &rsquo;t down&mdash;a blaze got up&mdash;<br />
    He&rsquo;d coupit owre the pan&mdash;<br />
    Quick as a squirrel he dreipit down<br />
    And owre the yard he ran,<br />
    As quick cam Johnnie to the front<br />
    A sair bewildered man;<br /><br />

    And standin&rsquo; out fornent the door<br />
    He stared up at the lum,<br />
    But fient a thing there could he see<br />
    Like either head or bum;<br />
    Then north he ran, then South again<br />
    The lum to look about,<br />
    But naething did he see or hear&mdash;<br />
    It must hae been Auld Cloot:<br /><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
    Anither might hae blamed some ghaist,<br />
    But Johnnie&rsquo;s faith was matter,<br />
    He never dreamed o&rsquo; starin banes,<br />
    His thoughts were something fatter&mdash;<br />
    He now looked up, then down the street<br />
    If he the cause could fin&rsquo;&mdash;<br />
    Jock keeking round the corner, now,<br />
    Said to his neighbours&mdash;rin.<br /><br />

    And aff they ran, and in an ace<br />
    They a&rsquo; were out o&rsquo; sight&mdash;<br />
    Now, Johnnie seeing naething that<br />
    Could throw on &rsquo;t ony light,<br />
    Bethinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; his pluck gaed in&mdash;<br />
    The sight was nane to please,<br />
    For some amang the ashes lay,<br />
    The rest was in a bleeze:<br /><br />

    Did Johnnie, hank&rsquo;rin&rsquo;, now sing dool?<br />
    Our birkies naething rued;<br />
    Nae sooner were they aff wi&rsquo; him<br />
    Than a new splore was brewed:<br />
    Though muckle tickled at the thought<br />
    O&rsquo; Johnnie&rsquo;s clappit wame&mdash;<br />
    Which might hae been as stent&rsquo;s a drum<br />
    And witness o&rsquo; its fame&mdash;<br /><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
    Yet mair, by far, they liked sic fun<br />
    As garred the bluid weel dance;<br />
    They liked a chase frae ane that could<br />
    Break wi&rsquo; them sic a lance:<br />
    Now, Jimmie Adams was that ane,<br />
    Nae daighie but guid mettle,<br />
    And he had what did recommend&mdash;<br />
    A wee spice o&rsquo; the nettle:<br /><br />

    That mettle they resolved that night<br />
    To put to sairest test,<br />
    Nor wad the faut be theirs if not<br />
    The nettle stung its best,<br />
    For Willie frae his pouch had taen<br />
    And charged a muckle scout,<br />
    And said that Jimmie he wad show<br />
    The wonders o&rsquo; a spout.<br /><br />

    Now weel they ken&rsquo;d that he wad chase<br />
    And that tae like a gru&rsquo;&mdash;<br />
    And whom he caught he&rsquo;d mak him squeel<br />
    As e&rsquo;re did ony sow&mdash;<br />
    But what had they to fear frae him?<br />
    Each suppler than anither,<br />
    Nor was there ane but what might be<br />
    To Asahel a brither.<br /><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
    But they made ready for the race;<br />
    Their breeks they buckled up;<br />
    Their bonnets pued down to their lugs;<br />
    Their jackets buttoned up;<br />
    And aff they a&rsquo; for Jimmie&rsquo;s set<br />
    When coming near the house,<br />
    They on their tiptaes slippit up<br />
    As quiet as ony mouse.<br /><br />

    Will by the curtain keeking in<br />
    Saw Jimmie at his supper,<br />
    And aye the spune gaun round the bowl,<br />

    He whispered this in Tammie&rsquo;s lug;<br />
    Tam oped the outer door&mdash;<br />
    Then Willie followed close behind<br />
    As silent as afore:<br /><br />

    Tam cautious oped the inner door,<br />
    It gied the slightest squeak,<br />
    And Jimmie wondrin&rsquo; what it was<br />
    In listenin&rsquo; turned his cheek&mdash;<br />
    Just then a strone frae Willie&rsquo;s scout<br />
    Shot right into the spune,<br />
    Which was as fixed in middle way<br />
    Between the bowl and chin:<br /><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
    Bang, bang, gaed inner, outer door&mdash;<br />
    Nor Jimmie wi&rsquo; a clout<br />
    Did dicht the parritch frae his face,<br />
    But up, and he was out:<br />
    Now, Tam and Will did trip and fa&rsquo;,<br />
    Ane north, ane south, were seen&mdash;<br />
    Out Jimmie cam, and trippit tae,<br />

    First down, first up, they aff like hares,<br />
    Each takin&rsquo; different airts;<br />
    Nor there lay Jimmie lang to grane<br />
    And haud the bluidin parts&mdash;<br />
    But like a gru&rsquo; he aff and ran<br />
    Wi&rsquo; bicker down the street&mdash;<br />
    Na need had Tam, nor did he let<br />
    The dirt stick to his feet.<br /><br />

    First down ae street, then up anither,<br />
    Then through an entry ran&mdash;<br />
    Here Jimmie, furious, in the dark,<br />
    Maist coupit owre a man&mdash;<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
    Thus Tam did lead, thus Jimmie chased,<br />
    Maist owre half o&rsquo; the town,<br />
    But wishing Jimmie warmer wark<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
